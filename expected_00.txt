Welcome to Fun with Numbers!

x = 1
y = 2
z = 3
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

Checking for equivalencies...

a = x
b = y
c = z

We are in business!

Right now, c = 3 and x = 1
Let's square c while simultaneously incrementing x, shall we?
Once x = 5, we will stop.

Squaring and incrementing...
3
Squaring and incrementing...
9
Squaring and incrementing...
81
Squaring and incrementing...
6561
Squared c 5 times!
Final value: 43046721

Let's try and grab just the first 4 digits...
4304
Then if we subtract 100...
4204
Then let's slice it in half...
2102
Since I'm writing this at 3:00 a.m., let's add 3...
2105
And before we go lets move some things around...
2015
And with that we can all say goodbye to 2015!

HAPPY NEW YEAR!
